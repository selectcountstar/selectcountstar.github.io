## Approach

Data analytics pipelines are a complex endevour. And as such are a time
a consuming activity both for the corporate departments as well as for the small
and medium enterprise. The complexity is related to three aspects.  

1) Selection of the right set of data analytics components  
2) Configuration of each data component    
3) Integration and setup of the data pipelines  
4) Everything else: CI/CD, Security, DTAP, Logging etc  

What if someone could lift this work from you and already deliver you the
platform you need? This is exactly what we do at SELECT COUNT(\*). We provide to
you tested, secured and ready-to-use data environments, and guide you in the
process of extracting information and generating ideas fast from your data.

We have made the setup of a data lab a simple process through a friendly UI
tour, which will provide guide you through the process of selecting the best
setup according to the goal of your domain (retail, telecom, banking, fintech,
marketing, logistics)

We believe that data analysts should not wait for months before having the
chance to dig in the data, and we believe that data engineers and devops can be
be more productive by jump starting their configuration using our templates.

## workshops

### "The Ultimate Open Source Data Engineering Demo"
Come and join us for our workshop "The Ultimate Open Source Data Engineering
Demo". Where we put together and end-to-end pipeline for data analytics,
customer segmentation using AI and a reccomender system using jupyter lab,
jupyter notebook, minio, spark, airflow, elasticsearch, logstash, kibana, kafka,
postgres, clickhouse, apache arrow, tensorflow, keras, pytorch, docker and
kubernetes.

Warning this is not a toy demo. It will provide you real insight on how to
build world class data pipelines and predictive APIS. It's real data processing
for a real-world DTAP, CI/CD, and logging for realistic dataset and recommender
application. Limited availability to 20 engineers and managers every week.

guarantee the maximum confidentiality and security on the data being analyzed.
You can decide to your own user collaboration strategy, such as isolated,
federated or shared data patterns.

Databox is ideal for both data science experiments as well as production
workflows. The web app will generate the right template for you depending on
your typical Data Applications such as Ingestion, ETL, Reporting, EDA, Data
Science.

Multiple domain specific visualization apps are already available for your
advanced analytics use cases, such as recommenders, classifiers, anomaly
detectors, and data clustering. Both available as APIs, Notebooks, and Web Apps
to serve and boost analytics for everyone, from the business analyst to the data
scientist.

Very rich Data Exploratory Environment, with all the main packages, storage,
processing engines and web application already pre-installed to jump start your
data analysis and produce results and insight from day one.

DTAP ready so you can test, develop and stage your data pipelines without
spending hours setting up the CI/CD environment and code multiple
configurations. Logging and monitoring is also part of the databox with an
already configured kafka bus to log all steps in your data processing pipeline.

Databox will setup for you the following components: jupyter lab, jupyter
notebook, hdfs, minio, spark, airflow, elasticsearch, logstash, kibana, kafka,
and a variety of databases such as postgres, mysql for transactional workload
and clickhouse for OLAP analytics.

Databox let you mix and match Data Preparation, ETL, Machine Learning and AI, so
that you can control your data pipeline as an end-to-end process. Moreover we
preconfigure for you, tensorflow, keras, pythorch, scikit-learn as part of a
selected list of over 100 packages to serve the most experienced data scientist
needs.
